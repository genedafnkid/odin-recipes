    <h2><img src="https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lumpiang-shanghai-4.jpg"></h2>
    <p><strong>Lumpiang Shanghai </strong> is a Filipino-style spring roll made of ground pork, chicken or beef filling wrapped in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers.</p>
    <p>The meat-stuffed lumpia is rolled into a thin cylindrical shape, cut into bite-size lengths and deep-fried to golden perfection. Itâ€™s traditionally enjoyed with a choice of dipping sauces such as <strong><em>sweet and sour, lechon sarsa, banana ketchup, and sweet chili</em></strong>.</p>
    <h3> INGRIDIENTS </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ground Pork<li>
      <li>Lumpia Wrapper</li>
      <li>Water Chestnuts</li>

    <h3>METHOD</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, combine ground chicken, green onions, water chestnuts, carrots, garlic, soy sauce, salt, and pepper until well distributed.</li>
      <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets and lay on a flat working surface.</li>
      <li>Spoon about 1 heaping tablespoon of meat mixture on the lower end of the wrapper, closest to you.</li>
      <li>Fold the bottom of wrapper over filling and continue to roll tightly into a thin log about 3/4-inch thick. Wet the remaining edge of the wrapper with a dab of water to completely seal.</li>
      <li>Repeat with the remaining mixture. Using scissors, cut each lumpia roll into about 3-inch lengths.</li>
      <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep of oil. Add lumpia in batches and cook turning on sides as needed, for about 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and crisp and meat is cooked through.</li>
      <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or banana ketchup.</li>
